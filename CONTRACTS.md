# Trail Checker — CONTRACTS.md

**Team:** Cache Kings
**Project repo:** [https://github.com/TCSS506-CacheKings/Trail-checker](https://github.com/TCSS506-CacheKings/Trail-checker)
**Status:** Draft for team review before implementation
**Team members and roles:**

| Member        | Role            |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Ryan Belmonte | Server-side     |
| Liam Sipp     | Client-side     |
| Nick Stjern   | DB-and-security |

## 0. Project summary

Trail Checker is a Flask + Postgres web app that helps hikers quickly check whether a trailhead or outdoor location looks reasonable to visit based on current weather and air quality. A user enters a location name, the app resolves it to coordinates, retrieves current weather and air pollution data, and displays a simple trail-readiness summary. Logged-in users can save locations they care about and remove saved locations later.

The Week 6 implementation is intentionally small. We are not building a full hiking map, trail database, or official trail-closure system yet. The goal is a reliable end-to-end slice: browser → Flask routes → Postgres → OpenWeather APIs → rendered condition results.

## 1. Schema

Existing skeleton tables remain unless explicitly changed below.

### users

| Column        | Type     | Constraints / notes                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| id            | integer  | Primary key                               |
| username      | string   | Required, unique, indexed                 |
| password_hash | string   | Required; never store plaintext passwords |
| created_at    | datetime | Required; default current UTC timestamp   |

Notes:

* DB-and-security will refactor authentication from direct `session["user_id"]` access to Flask-Login.
* The `users` table may keep the skeleton's original structure if it already satisfies these fields, but it must support Flask-Login's user loading by id.

### saved_trails

| Column       | Type     | Constraints / notes                                                     |

| id           | integer  | Primary key                                                             |
| user_id      | integer  | Required foreign key to `users.id`; cascade delete when user is deleted |
| display_name | string   | Required; human-readable location name shown to the user                |
| query_text   | string   | Required; original search text submitted by the user                    |
| latitude     | float    | Required                                                                |
| longitude    | float    | Required                                                                |
| country      | string   | Optional; from geocoding response                                       |
| state        | string   | Optional; from geocoding response when available                        |
| notes        | string   | Optional; user note, max 500 characters                                 |

| updated_at   | datetime | Required; update when notes or display name change                      |

Constraints:

* `user_id` must reference a valid user.
* A user should not be able to create exact duplicate saved trails with the same `user_id`, `latitude`, and `longitude`.
* Deleting a user must delete that user's saved trails.

Notes:

* `trail_checks` is a lightweight audit/history table for searches. It helps the team prove data is persisted, but the UI does not need a full history page in Week 6.
* The app may skip writing a `trail_checks` row if the external API call fails before usable data is returned.

## 2. Endpoint contracts

### Shared response conventions

HTML routes return rendered templates or redirects with flash messages.

JSON API routes use this success envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

JSON API routes use this error envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "machine_readable_code",
    "message": "Human readable explanation"
  }
}
```

Common error codes:

| Status | Code                       | Meaning                                                         |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `invalid_input`            | Missing, too short, too long, or malformed user input           |
| 401    | `login_required`           | User must be logged in for this action                          |
| 404    | `not_found`                | Resource does not exist, or does not belong to the current user |
| 502    | `external_api_error`       | OpenWeather returned malformed/unusable data                    |
| 503    | `external_api_unavailable` | Timeout, rate limit, bad API key, or service unavailable        |

3. Use the first geocoding result unless no results are returned.
4. Call OpenWeather Current Weather API using resolved `lat` and `lon`.
5. Call OpenWeather Air Pollution API using resolved `lat` and `lon`.
6. Compute a simple recommendation:

   * `poor` if AQI is 4 or 5, or wind speed is very high, or weather indicates thunderstorm/extreme conditions.
   * `caution` if AQI is 3, rain/snow is present, visibility is low, or wind is moderately high.
   * `good` if AQI is 1-2 and conditions are mild.
   * `unknown` if weather data exists but recommendation cannot be confidently computed.
7. Persist a `trail_checks` row when usable weather data is returned.
8. Render results page.

## 3. External API contract

Primary external provider: OpenWeather.

### API key handling

* Store key in environment variable: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`.
* Never hardcode the key in Python, templates, tests, `.env` committed to git, README screenshots, or terminal logs.
* If the key is missing, server routes that need OpenWeather must return `503 external_api_unavailable` with a clear message.

### OpenWeather Geocoding API

Docs: [https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)

Endpoint:

```text
GET http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={query}&limit=1&appid={API key}
```

Auth:

* API key required through `appid`.

Inputs:

* `query`: user location input from `q`.
* `limit`: use `1` for MVP to keep behavior deterministic.

Expected response shape:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Mount Rainier",
    "lat": 46.8523,
    "lon": -121.7603,
    "country": "US",
    "state": "Washington"
  }
]
```

Failure handling:

* Empty array: return `404 not_found`.
* Timeout: return `503 external_api_unavailable`.
* HTTP 401 or invalid key: return `503 external_api_unavailable`.
* HTTP 429/rate limit: return `503 external_api_unavailable`.
* Missing `lat` or `lon`: return `502 external_api_error`.

### OpenWeather Current Weather API

Docs: [https://openweathermap.org/current](https://openweathermap.org/current)

Endpoint:

```text
GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}&units=imperial
```

Auth:

* API key required through `appid`.

Expected response fields used:

* `weather[0].main`
* `weather[0].description`
* `main.temp`
* `main.feels_like`
* `main.humidity`
* `wind.speed`
* `visibility`
* `name`

* HTTP 401 or invalid key: return `503 external_api_unavailable`.
* HTTP 429/rate limit: return `503 external_api_unavailable`.
* Non-200 response: return `503 external_api_unavailable`.
* Missing required fields: return `502 external_api_error`.

### OpenWeather Air Pollution API

Docs: [https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution)

Endpoint:

```text
GET http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/air_pollution?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
```

Auth:

* API key required through `appid`.

Expected response fields used:

* `list[0].main.aqi`
* `list[0].components.pm2_5`
* `list[0].components.pm10`

Failure handling:

* Timeout: do not fail the entire result if weather data succeeded. Render weather results and set air quality fields to `None` / unknown with a warning flash.
* HTTP 401 or invalid key: same as timeout behavior if weather succeeded.
* HTTP 429/rate limit: same as timeout behavior if weather succeeded.
* Malformed response: same as timeout behavior if weather succeeded.

### Rate limits and free-tier concern

OpenWeather free/self-service access should be enough for Week 6 development and demo usage. The team will avoid polling and will only call the APIs after user-initiated searches or saved-trail rechecks.

Implementation rule:

* No background refresh jobs.
* No automatic repeated requests from JavaScript.
* Each user search may produce up to three external calls: geocoding, current weather, and air pollution.

## 4. Authorization rules

### Anonymous users

Anonymous users may:

* View `/` and existing skeleton public pages.
* View `/trail-checker`.
* Search `/trail-checker/results?q=...`.
* Call `/api/conditions?q=...`.

Anonymous users may not:

* View `/saved-trails`.
* Save a trail.
* Delete a saved trail.
* Re-check a saved trail by id.

### Logged-in users

Logged-in users may:

* Do everything anonymous users can do.
* Save a trail/location from search results.
* View only their own saved trails.
* Delete only their own saved trails.
* Re-check only their own saved trails.

### Ownership restrictions

* A user requesting another user's saved trail must receive `404 Not Found`, not `403 Forbidden`.
* This applies to:

  * `POST /saved-trails/<trail_id>/delete`
  * `GET /saved-trails/<trail_id>/check`
* The app should not reveal whether another user's saved trail id exists.

### Input validation and security

* All location text input must be trimmed and length-limited.
* Notes must be length-limited to 500 characters.
* Latitude and longitude must be parsed as floats and range-checked.
* Jinja templates must rely on default escaping and must not use unsafe `|safe` for user-provided content.
* External API key must stay in environment variables.
* Server-side code must not trust hidden form fields beyond validation.
* Database constraints should back up application-level checks where possible.

## 5. Role boundaries

### Server-side — Ryan

Owns:

* Flask route handlers for new project routes.
* OpenWeather API integration using `requests`.
* External API timeout, status-code, and malformed-response handling.
* Recommendation calculation helper.
* JSON envelope for `/api/conditions`.
* Server-side tests: `tests/test_server_conditions.py`.

Primary files likely touched:

* `app.py`
* Optional helper file such as `weather_service.py` or `trail_service.py` if the team agrees
* `tests/test_server_conditions.py`

Should not own:

* Final visual layout of templates.

* `templates/trail_results.html`
* `templates/saved_trails.html`
* `static/js/forms.js` only if needed for form UX, without breaking Week 5 behavior
* Optional `static/css` file if the skeleton has one
* `tests/test_client_templates.py`

Should not own:

* API calls from Flask.
* Database schema constraints.
* Authorization logic.

Owns:

* SQLModel models and schema constraints.
* Foreign keys and cascade behavior.
* Flask-Login refactor.
* Login-required enforcement.
* Ownership checks and 404-for-not-yours behavior.
* Input validation review.
* Secret hygiene review for `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`.
* DB/security tests: `tests/test_db_security.py`.

Primary files likely touched:

* `app.py`
* Optional `models.py` if the team agrees to split models out
* `tests/test_db_security.py`

Should not own:

* Final page styling.
* External API response mapping beyond validating that stored data is safe.

### Shared coordinator work, because this is a 3-person team

Since the team has three members, there is no separate coordinator role. The team shares coordinator responsibilities.

Shared responsibilities:

* Review and approve this `CONTRACTS.md` before role implementation starts.
* Commit four initially failing tests before implementation begins.
* Maintain `coord_session.md` with real planning notes, questions, and decisions.
* Make `tests/test_integration.py` pass once all role slices are implemented.
* Write and run the whole-system `e2e.md`.

Integration test file:

* `tests/test_integration.py`
* Owner: shared, with final review from all three members.

## 6. Initial test contracts

The Week 6 contract PR should add these tests before implementation work begins. They should fail at first because the app has not implemented these features yet.

### `tests/test_server_conditions.py`

Owner: Ryan, server-side.

Should assert:

* `/api/conditions?q=Mount%20Rainier` returns `200` with `ok: true` when OpenWeather responses are mocked.
* The success payload includes `weather`, `air_quality`, and `recommendation` keys.
* Invalid short query returns `400 invalid_input`.
* Geocoding empty result returns `404 not_found`.
* OpenWeather timeout returns `503 external_api_unavailable`.
* Malformed weather response returns `502 external_api_error`.

### `tests/test_db_security.py`

Owner: Nick, DB-and-security.

Should assert:

* `saved_trails` table exists with expected columns.
* `trail_checks` table exists with expected columns.
* Saved trails require a valid `user_id`.
* Duplicate exact saved trail for same user is rejected or gracefully prevented.
* Anonymous user cannot access `/saved-trails`.
* User A cannot delete or re-check User B's saved trail and gets `404`.

### `tests/test_client_templates.py`

Owner: Liam, client-side.

Should assert:

* `/trail-checker` renders a form with `action="/trail-checker/results"`, `method="GET"`, and input named `q`.
* The Trail Checker page has a submit button.
* The base navbar includes a link to `/trail-checker`.
* The results template includes stable selectors/classes for weather card, air quality card, and recommendation badge.
* `/saved-trails` page has an empty-state container when no saved trails exist.
* Tests should check structure and selectors, not exact marketing copy.

### `tests/test_integration.py`

Owner: shared.

Should assert:

* User can register or log in.
* Logged-in user can search a realistic location with mocked OpenWeather responses.
* User can save the returned location.
* Saved location appears on `/saved-trails`.
* User can re-check that saved location.
* User can delete the saved location.
* Deleted location no longer appears on `/saved-trails`.

## 7. Whole-system E2E expectations

The final `e2e.md` must exercise:

1. Fresh app startup with Docker Compose.
2. Login/register flow.
3. Anonymous Trail Checker search page.
4. Real OpenWeather search with a realistic outdoor location.
5. Real OpenWeather edge/weird query that may expose contract gaps.
6. Logged-in save flow.
7. Saved trails list page.
8. Re-check saved trail flow.
9. Delete saved trail flow.
10. Ownership probe with two users, if time allows.

At least one E2E step must hit the real OpenWeather service, not mocked fixtures.

## 8. Known limitations for Week 6

The team is deliberately punting the following:

* No official trail closure/status data. The app checks weather and air quality near a location; it does not know whether a trail is officially open or closed.
* No map UI. Coordinates may be shown as text, but we are not embedding maps yet.
* No autocomplete. Search is a normal text field.
* No advanced location disambiguation. The first geocoding result is used for MVP. A later version can let users pick from multiple results.
* No background refresh. Conditions update only when the user searches or re-checks a saved trail.
* No OAuth yet. Week 6 uses the skeleton login flow refactored to Flask-Login; OAuth is expected later.
* No mobile-first polish beyond reasonable Bootstrap responsiveness.
* No production-grade rate-limit handling. We handle OpenWeather failures gracefully, but we do not implement local caching or request throttling this week.
* No user profile settings.
* No public sharing of saved trails.

## 9. Open questions for team review

Ryan should confirm:

* Whether `/api/conditions` and `/trail-checker/results` should share one helper function.
* Whether he wants to split OpenWeather logic into `weather_service.py` instead of keeping it in `app.py`.

Nick should confirm:

* Exact SQLModel syntax for composite uniqueness on saved trails.
* Whether cascade delete is practical in the current skeleton setup.
* Whether Flask-Login should be added in the same PR as schema or separately.

Liam should confirm:

* Exact Bootstrap layout for result cards.
* Stable CSS selectors/classes that tests can target without locking copy.
* Whether saved trail notes are included in the first UI pass or left as a hidden/simple optional field.

Team should confirm:

* Whether using only OpenWeather is acceptable for the current version.
* Whether the app name should be `Trail Checker`, `TrailCheck`, or another final display name.
* Whether the repo route names should use `/trail-checker` or shorter `/trails` paths.
